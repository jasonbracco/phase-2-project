## Get to know the Yankees app
This program allows you to view the current roster of the New York Yankees, view their statistics, and create a new player to add on to the roster.  Each of these components are programmatically navigatable.  

## Functionality
The home screen will tell you all about the app.  The navigation bar will lead you to your destination, whether you want to just see the roster, search for a player and then show their statistics, or create a new player to add to the roster.  Adding a new player is takes shape as an input form, and finding the statistics of a player is a simple as clicking on their player card.
